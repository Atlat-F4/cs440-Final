README for Code Comment Classification Project
Project Title
Code Comment Classification using NLP and Machine Learning

Project Description
This project focuses on multi-label classification of code comments to assign appropriate labels describing their functionality. Using the NLBSE/nlbse25-code-comment-classification dataset, we preprocess, balance, and classify code comments using NLP techniques and machine learning models. The ultimate goal is to build a high-performance classification system that supports efficient code management and analysis.
